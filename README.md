# DS1001-LABS-Projects
Contains the starting code for DS1001 Project Labs (LABS3, LABS6, LABS9, LABS12).

## Running the Labs Script

The consolidated `labs_script.py` merges the code from the LABS-03_Systems notebook into a single executable Python script.

To run the script:
```bash
python3 labs_script.py
```

This script will:
- Verify your Python environment is set up correctly
- Test that pandas is installed
- Provide a function to load data from CSV files
